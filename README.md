### Seaborn plots and Univariate Analysis on Iris-dataaet

This project focuses on **Univariate Analysis**, a statistical method to summarize and analyze individual variables in a dataset. Using **Seaborn**, a Python visualization library, this repository demonstrates how to explore and understand distributions, frequencies, and descriptive statistics of single variables effectively.

#### Key Features:
- Visualization of **distributions** (e.g., histograms, KDE plots, box plots).
- Exploration of central tendencies (mean, median) and variability (variance, standard deviation).
- Identification of **outliers** and **patterns** in single-variable data.
- Simple and customizable Seaborn-based plots for intuitive data representation.

#### Tools & Libraries:
- **Python**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib** (for supplementary visualizations)

#### Use Cases:
- Understanding data distributions for feature engineering.
- Identifying skewness and kurtosis in datasets.
- Enhancing decision-making with clear visual insights.

Feel free to clone, explore, and contribute to this repository for mastering univariate analysis and data visualization techniques! ðŸŒŸ
